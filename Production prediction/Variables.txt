## Feature descriptions

- **treatment company**: The treatment company who provides treatment service.
- **azimuth**: Well drilling direction.
- **md (ft)**: Measure depth.
- **tvd (ft)**: True vertical depth.
- **date on production**: First production date.
- **operator**: The well operator who performs drilling service.
- **footage lateral length**: Horizontal well section.
- **well spacing**: Distance to the closest nearby well.
- **porpoise deviation**: How much max (in ft.) a well deviated from its horizontal.
- **porpoise count**: How many times the deviations (porpoises) occurred.
- **shale footage**: How much shale (in ft) encountered in a horizontal well.
- **acoustic impedance**: The impedance of a reservoir rock (ft/s * g/cc).
- **log permeability**: The property of rocks that is an indication of the ability for fluids (gas or liquid) to flow through rocks
- **porosity**: The percentage of void space in a rock. It is defined as the ratio of the volume of the voids or pore space divided by the total volume. It is written as either a decimal fraction between 0 and 1 or as a percentage.
- **poisson ratio**: Measures the ratio of lateral strain to axial strain at linearly elastic region.
- **water saturation**: The ratio of water volume to pore volume.
- **toc**: Total Organic Carbon, indicates the organic richness (hydrocarbon generative potential) of a reservoir rock.
- **vcl**: The amount of clay minerals in a reservoir rock.
- **p-velocity**: The velocity of P-waves (compressional waves) through a reservoir rock (ft/s).
- **s-velocity**: The velocity of S-waves (shear waves) through a reservoir rock (ft/s).
- **youngs modulus**: The ratio of the applied stress to the fractional extension (or shortening) of the reservoir rock parallel to the tension (or compression) (giga pascals).
- **isip**: When the pumps are quickly stopped, and the fluids stop moving, these friction pressures disappear and the resulting pressure is called the instantaneous shut-in pressure, ISIP.
- **breakdown pressure**: The pressure at which a hydraulic fracture is created/initiated/induced.
- **pump rate**: The volume of liquid that travels through the pump in a given time. A hydraulic fracture is formed by pumping fluid into a wellbore at a rate sufficient to increase pressure at the target depth, to exceed that of the fracture gradient (pressure gradient) of the rock.
- **total number of stages**: Total stages used to fracture the horizontal section of the well.
- **proppant volume**: The amount of proppant in pounds used in the completion of a well (lbs).
- **proppant fluid ratio**: The ratio of proppant volume/fluid volume (lbs/gallon).
- **production**: The 12 months cumulative gas production (mmcf).
